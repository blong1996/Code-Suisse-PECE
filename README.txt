Problem Statement:
Credit Suisse used to have a global classifieds website that allowed internal CS staff to post ads for goods, services, apts for rent/sale. Vehicles, etc. [Similar to Craigslist for internal users]; The site was running on legacy technology which was being decommissioned. The site was up for well over 10+ years and was shut down in 2015. Since then, there has been no way for CS staff to share such information.

Our Solution:	
-We decided to create a fully responsive modern website for the problem. In our website we have included:
